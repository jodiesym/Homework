          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <hr>
          <h6>By selecting different axis label above, you can compare data types:</h6>
          <hr>
          <h3>Poverty vs.</h3>
          <p>Poverty and Lacks Healthcare --> It seems like when poverty increases, the percentage that lack healthcare increases too. TX appears as an outlier because it has the 
            highest "no healthcare" rate, but the poverty rate is not the highest. 
            <br>
            Poverty and Obesity --> When poverty increases, the obesity rate increases as well.
            <br>
            Poverty and Smokers --> This one doesn't show as strong a relationship as the other two, but still we can see that when the poverty percentage increases, the percentage of smokers
             smokers increases too. 
          </p>

          <h3>Age vs.</h3>
          <p>Overall UT has the youngest people, because the median age in UT is close to 30. People in VT have the highest median age which is over 42. 
            <br>
            Age and Lack healthcare --> There is no clear relationship between median age and the lack of healthcare.
            <br>
            Age and Obesity --> When age increases, the obesity rate appears to increase as well. However the correlation is not strong.
            <br>
            Age and Smokers --> When age increases, the percentage of smokers increases as well.
          </p>

          <h3>Income vs.</h3>
          <p>There is no clear relationship between median income and the lack of healthcare, but again TX is an outlier because it has the highest "no healthcare" rate but not the 
            lowest median income. 
          </p>
